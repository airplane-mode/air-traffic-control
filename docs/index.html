        <h1>Dead Simple Redux Routing</h1>
        <p>
          Air Traffic Control is the Redux router you've been waiting for. It lets you keep all of your routes in one place and map them directly to Redux actions so you can keep routing logic from getting scattered across your views.

                <p>
                  Route changes are actions, just like mouse clicks. They should be handled the same way, and they should certainly be kept out of your views. We believe that all of the existing routers for React/Redux treat route changes wrong, and Air Traffic Control aims to fix that.

            <p>
              Air Traffic Control is a Redux router, not a React router. It works great with React, but it also works equally well <strong>without</strong> React. We believe libraries are best when they require minimal ecosystem buy-in, and do one thing well.

            <h1 class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
            <h3 class="text-center">Encourages separation of concerns</h3>
            <p>
              The biggest drawback to most React applications is that they eschew separation of concerns by co-locating layout, styling, and routing in their views. We believe this maximizes lock-in and minimizes ability to scale. With Air Traffic Control, you can put your routes wherever you want, and they don't need to match up 1:1 with your views.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
            <h3 class="text-center">Action-based</h3>
            <p>
              A Redux action can change the route. A route can fire a Redux action. Air Traffic Control can even intercept all of the same-domain links in your app so they fire actions instead of just hiding and showing components.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means you donâ€™t need to preload all of the data in your Redux app's initial load.
